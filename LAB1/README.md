## Build a Network Automation LAB
### LAB1 Assignment

I built a physical lab with Juniper and Brocade equipment, as this is the gear that we run in our network.  To keep it simple at this point I have focused on connectivity to the Juniper EX2300 switch stacks in the LAB.  I included the other gear in the drawing as I will attempt to build Ansible solutions to it in future labs.
